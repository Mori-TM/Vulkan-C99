# Vulkan-C99
This is an older project were I wrote a vulkan renderer in good old c with only two external libraries (stb_image.h and SDL2). I has some bugs here and there. The project is no longer maintained, but I may help someone to learn vulkan. The code is about 2 years old and the structure is kind of questionable.
